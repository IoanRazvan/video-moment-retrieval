# video-moment-retrieval

This repository is a work in progress and contains experiments related to my dissertation thesis "Query-based Moment Retrieval from Videos".

Currently there is an initial implementation of [Moment-DETR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09609v2) which uses video and query features extracted from the QVHighlights dataset using the CLIP model (processed features can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14TQYce7S6iGd35y_E2d3ZDSD-RqNfv_O?usp=drive_link)).
